My personal repo for dumping stuff I'm playing with, including:

* my PowerShell profile
* `Find-Original` : a module I use as part of a project to consolidate a zillion different photo backups into a single Lightroom Library
* some old AutoHotKey script I don't use anymore

## Disclaimer

I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft working on [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/powershell/powershell), among other things.
